UNC School of Information and Library Science,"Library science classes were initially offered at UNC-Chapel Hill starting in 1904; however, the university would not offer library science as a major until 1931, when the School of Library Science opened its doors to welcome 37 students and five faculty members in Wilson Library, now named after Louis Round Wilson, the university's first librarian, the SILS' first dean, and advocate for library science at the university.[8] The school opened in part because of a $100,000 grant from the Carnegie Corporation given to the University to establish a school of library science.[8] In 1932, the school was provisionally accredited by the ALA Board of Education for Librarianship,[8] the same year that the first class of students would graduate from the school.[8] Two years later, the school became fully accredited for undergraduate library training by the ALA Board of Education for Librarianship.[8]

Wilson Library, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC The Carnegie Corporation gave SILS another $100,000 grant in 1940.[8] Starting in 1950, the school offered master's courses in library science[8] leading the way for the university to approve the school's program, leading to the creation of the school's MSLS program.[8]

Two decades after the launch of its MSLS program, SILS moved out of its original home, Wilson Library, and into its current home, Manning Hall, the former home of the UNC School of Law.[8]

In 1974, the school began offering library services to the Environmental Protection Agency Library at Research Triangle Park.[8]

The school officially changed its name from the School of Library Science to the School of Information and Library Science in 1988 after a faculty vote in 1987, recognizing the growing role information management would have on society.[8]

Now, SILS offers an undergraduate major and minor, two master's of science degrees, professional science master's degrees, dual master's degrees with both their own undergraduate degree and other programs at the University, several graduate certificates, and a doctor of philosophy in information and library science.[9] One of SILS' newest degrees, a professional science master's (PSM) in digital curation, is the first master's degree in the nation focused on digital curation and is offered entirely online.[10]

In the fall of 2017, SILS had 160 undergraduate students either pursuing a major in information science or a minor in information systems, with an additional 254 graduate students enrolled.[11]",en
Wuhan University School of Information Management,"The School of Information Management (SIM) of Wuhan University is the oldest and largest Library and Information Science (LIS) education and research institution in China. The predecessor of SIM was Boone Library School at Wuchang, which was founded by Mary Elizabeth Wood and Samuel T. Y. Seng in March 1920. In 1953, Boone Library School at Wuchang merged into Wuhan University and became Wuhan University's Department of Library Science. In 1984, it was approved by the Ministry of Education of China (MOE) to set up the School of Library and Information Science of Wuhan University and it has become the School of Information Management of Wuhan University since 2001.[1]",en
Berlin School of Library and Information Science,"Das Institut wurde 1953/54 an der Philosophischen Fakultät der Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin zunächst als Fachrichtung Bibliothekswissenschaft eingerichtet. 1954 wurde dann das Institut gegründet. Ein Vorläuferinstitut existierte von 1928 bis 1934 unter der Leitung eines Begründers der Bibliothekswissenschaft, Fritz Milkau.

Nach der deutschen Wiedervereinigung wurden die beiden bibliothekswissenschaftlichen Studiengänge der Freien Universität Berlin und der Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin vereinigt. Anfang der 2000er Jahre erwog die Humboldt-Universität die Schließung des Instituts; sie entschied dann jedoch zugunsten einer grundlegenden Neuausrichtung und Modernisierung und stellte dafür auch die notwendigen finanziellen Ressourcen bereit.

Das Ziel der 2006 begonnenen Neuausrichtung war eine international wettbewerbsfähige Institution nach dem Vorbild der „iSchools“ oder Information school. Das neue Curriculum erhielt eine wesentlich stärkere Ausrichtung auf die digitale Entwicklung und die Kompetenzen, die in ihrem Kontext erforderlich sind. Dazu gehören insbesondere auch Forschung und Forschungsmethoden. Das IBI ist ein Universitätsinstitut mit einer starken Forschungsorientierung. Darin unterscheidet es sich auch von den Instituten und Studiengängen der früheren Fachhochschulen.",de
